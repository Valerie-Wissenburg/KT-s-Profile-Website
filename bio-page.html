          <h2>Biography</h2>
        </header>
        <p>“K-TEEEE, whatup bro!” Ya Boi KT has gained a reputation for pretty much being the coolest kid of the block. Now he’s a rapper too? Crazy.  In the upcoming years, KT hopes to add even more spunk to the rapidly growing Midwest hip-hop scene.</p>
        <p>Born and raised in Milwaukee, WI, Ya Boi KT has always possessed a love for music. From singing solos in his local church to winning the Director's Award in his grade school band, this young artist has many proud accomplishments under his belt. While attending Rufus King IB High School, he also was a part of the now 8-time city championship drumline.</p>
        <p>As a college student attending the University of Nebraska in Lincoln, KT decided to enroll in a poetry class in 2011.  Ever since then, he has been hooked on writing about his life experiences and those still yet to come.  At this time, he was also was strongly influenced to take up a music career by his good friend, and fellow hip-hop artist Tsunami.</p>
        <p>Ever since writing his first official song “Mastermind in the Making” as a 19-yr old, he’s developed a huge passion for hip-hop.  From his catchy hooks, to his meaningful, thought-provoking verses, KT is on the verge of something special. While still in college, KT released his first mixtape titled, Crash Course.  This project includes 16 tracks about his day to day life as a college student in Lincoln, NE.  He also touches on growing up in the streets of Milwaukee, and how his life has changed since high school.</p>
        <p>Upon graduating from UNL in December of 2014, KT has expanded his music career by performing locally in Lincoln.  In 2015, his first year of performing, KT managed to headline four shows in Lincoln.  In addition, he opened for the Nappy Roots and Long Beach artist Joey Fatts. Over the years, Ya Boi KT and his peers have launched a music group called the Hot Husker Hooligans with a Life of Vision affiliation.  KT has also started releasing several intriguing music videos on his YouTube page, and he is selling merchandise to promote his sophomore mixtape Opinionated.</p>
        <p>Opinionated includes 14 original tracks that highlight numerous topics in KT’s life.  He prides himself in having a lot of variety on this project to keep fans on their toes. He even caught the attention of former MMA fighter and DJ Houston Alexander.  Houston hosted KT on his Power Mix Sunday Night show, which simultaneously gave KT radio play on Omaha’s Power 106.9.   KT’s first radio single has a smooth R&B feel to it, and is titled, “Hold You Down” featuring Apollo.
          From this point on, KT is continuing to promote his music locally both in Lincoln and Milwaukee.  He is now actively seeking to go on tour with his newest friend, The Ripsta.  Ya Boi KT’s strong motivation, innovative mind, and charismatic personality are bound to land him in a great spot in today’s hip-hop industry.</p>

          <h2>Thank You</h2>
        </header>
        <p>I want to say ‘thank you’ to all of my friends, family, and fans who have been supporting me throughout this journey.  This independent project means a lot to me, and I’m very excited to share it, my thoughts, and these ‘opinions’ with everyone.  Although this is my second independent project to date, this is only the beginning of my career, God willing.  There is so much more to come, and I look forward to seeing it all unfold before me. </p>
        <p>My dream is to create music for a living, to where I can reach more people as I go along.  I can now say that I’ve found my true passion, and I honestly love it! Find your shine in whatever you decide you want to do in life, and never, NEVER let anything nor anyone stop you from chasing down that dream! Again, I just want to give due thanks to the Lord, who without nothing is possible, and to my fans and everyone who’s been by my side from the start…#Opinionated</p>
